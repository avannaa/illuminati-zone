## introduction

oh, heya there. welcome to the theoretical corner.  
[end of 2021 edit: it must be said that approximately all of this has been obsoleted by Acrisio's posted solutions~ so, read at your own curiosity]

THERE IS ONLY TEXT AND FORMULAE HERE!!  
there won't be any excel files or anything. however, if this sounds interesting to you, you might figure a way to add this to your own excel (or whatever method you prefer)..  
in fact, if your only goal is to shoot -40s, you don't even need any of this. current formulas are "good enough" and all you have to do is to input the correct stuff.  
however, if you are actually interested in truly understanding the game mechanics.. you might find something interesting.

if there's one reason why i still cared about this game, it's not because i wanna get the best scores possible - it's because i wanted to get answers to decade old questions.  
i'm sure that some people out there have already figured this stuff out, but it's not too often that people want to talk about the theoretical side of things.  
as far as i know, they haven't shared much, but if they did, please tell me :D

now that it's much easier to set up your own private server, high quality data collecting is accessible to a lot more people.
