## introduction

oh, heya there. welcome to the theoretical corner.

THERE IS ONLY TEXT HERE!!  
there will barely be any actual formulas, and there definitely won't be any excel files or anything.  
in fact, if your only goal is to shoot -40s, you don't even need any of this. current formulas are "good enough" and all you have to do is to input the correct stuff.  
however, if you are actually interested in truly understanding the game mechanics.. you might find something interesting.

if there's one reason why i still care about this game, it's not because i wanna get the best scores possible - it's because i wanna get answers to decade old questions.  
i'm sure that some people out there have already figured this stuff out, but it's not too often that people want to talk about the theoretical side of things.  
as far as i know, they haven't shared much, but if they did, please tell me :D

now that it's much easier to set up your own private server, high quality data collecting is accessible to a lot more people.  
[here's a random youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaDUITcssYw) (in portuguese, but no big deal) if you need some direction.

## some questions that i've already put enough time into (clickable links Soon™)
- [a theoretical approach to power calculation](https://github.com/sera-pangya/illuminati-zone/blob/main/theoretical-power/theoretical-power.md)
- what's the proper relationship between hwi and vwi

i'm already using that knowledge in my own actual gameplay! i don't think it's quite ready for shipping, though.

## some questions that i'm still investigating
- what's the proper relationship between height and hwi
- a general approach to the influence of height on power

## some of my ultimate goals
- a formula to generate quality data for any drive without any actual experimentation
- some general solutions to heights (e.g. ALL toma-heights, dunk-heights, spike-heights for any drive)

if you are interested and/or have something to contribute, please contact me :o
