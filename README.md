## introduction

oh, heya there. welcome to the theoretical corner.

THERE IS ONLY TEXT HERE!!  
there will barely be any actual formulas, and there definitely won't be any excel files or anything. however, if this sounds interesting to you, you might figure a way to add this to your own excel (or whatever method you prefer)..  
in fact, if your only goal is to shoot -40s, you don't even need any of this. current formulas are "good enough" and all you have to do is to input the correct stuff.  
however, if you are actually interested in truly understanding the game mechanics.. you might find something interesting.

if there's one reason why i still care about this game, it's not because i wanna get the best scores possible - it's because i wanna get answers to decade old questions.  
i'm sure that some people out there have already figured this stuff out, but it's not too often that people want to talk about the theoretical side of things.  
as far as i know, they haven't shared much, but if they did, please tell me :D

now that it's much easier to set up your own private server, high quality data collecting is accessible to a lot more people.  
[here's a random youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaDUITcssYw) (in portuguese, but no big deal) if you need some direction.

## some possibly interesting questions that i've already put enough time into (clickable links Soonâ„¢)
- [a theoretical approach to power calculation](https://github.com/sera-pangya/illuminati-zone/blob/main/theoretical-power/theoretical-power.md)
- heights are hard
- spike shots don't make sense
- [slopes in the game memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SICC0WO3RFA) (might fully figure it out when i feel like putting a few more hours)
- why nobody has a general calculator for cobras

i'm already using that knowledge in my own actual gameplay! i don't think most of it is quite ready for shipping, though.

## some questions that i'm currently investigating
- slopes in the game memory
- [ways to collect data faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJmMTskVOyE)

## some of my ultimate goals
- a formula to generate quality data for any drive without any actual experimentation
- some general solutions to heights (i.e. height influence on power and aim for ALL toma-heights, dunk-heights, spike-heights for any drive)
- ~~slopes wtf~~ (almost done)

if you are interested and/or have something to contribute, please contact me :o  
if nothing else, you can find me on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/fate)
